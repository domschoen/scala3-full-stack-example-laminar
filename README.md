# Example full-stack Scala 3 project using Laminar

Based on the example "Example full-stack Scala 3 project": https://github.com/adpi2/scala3-full-stack-example which was presented at ScalaCon in May 2021 but using Laminar for the frontend: https://laminar.dev/

It is also using the template https://github.com/vmunier/akka-http-scalajs.g8 in order to have continuous compilation (see note below)



## Continuous compilation

For some reason, not related to Laminar, specific to akka-http-scala.js, the page is not refreshed after a recompilation and refresh of browser. To get full refreshed page, you need also to do a clear history of your browser.
